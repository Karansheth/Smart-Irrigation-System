# Smart-Irrigation-System

We have developed a smart irrigation system using IoT hardware and an application in MIT app inventor. The application shows the real-time temperature, humidity, and moisture content of the soil. It also suggests the water content required for any particular crop to the farmers. Here, farmers can decide water content and can transfer water through the application by turning the motor on-off.
